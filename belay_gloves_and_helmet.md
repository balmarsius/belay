## Why I look the Way I look

I wear a blue helmet, belay glasses, and brown leather full-finger belay gloves.

As a belayer, I take longer to belay than my own climber. But it is simple. In climbing, activities and equipment can be generally categorized into two:

```Markdown
#### Safety
and
#### Performance
```

Helmet and gloves fall into the safety side of things. I can do without them, but I prefer to have them. As belayer, the more you protect yourself, the better you protect your climber. Think of the airline safety demos: put your masks on before putting masks for other people.

### Helmet

Climbers drop things all the time: rocks, dirt, leaves, and lizards! I know cases of climbers dropping snakes on their belayer. While a helmet will not protect you against falling snakes, it does protect from choss, dirt, and quickdraws. Climbers drop quickdraws more often than they are willing to admit.

As I always say: I have half a brain. I might as well protect it!

### Gloves

No glove, no love. This is a more personal choice. I like to wear gloves because I feed rope better when I do. 

I also discovered a non-intended use for it one time while I was climbing in Huu Lung. My friend Diana, a complete Tollpatsch, dropped a draw from 12 meters up while cleaning a route. I caught the draw with my gloved hand. That thing did not land like a feather on my hand. But the leather made the difference.

### Belay Glasses

Everyone should have these! Saves your neck. Makes you belay longer. There's a steep learning curve but this curve mellows down pretty quick.

### Flipflops

I'm Filipino. Back home, we wear flipflops all the time. My wide feet tell the story of growing up in the freedom of air-cooled, dirt-welcoming flipflops. Is it ideal to wear flipflops while belaying? No. Have I been hurt because I was wearing flipfopls while belaying? No. 

But yes, shoes are ideal.

### Wrap up

When belaying, I recommend wearing a helmet and shoes. Belay glasses are ideal especially if you are belaying someone who is projecting. I prefer to wear gloves and gloves have served me well.
