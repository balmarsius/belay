## Intro: I am The Best Belayer

If you have ever climbed in:
```
Cebu
Cat Ba
Tonsai
Green Climbers Home
Huu Lung
```

You probably have met me. 

I am the self-proclaimed `Best Belayer`. In Cat Ba, I'm called `The Best Hands on the Island`. (`Best Hands` is a reference to an activity in the NFL Pro Bowl.) My climbing partner in Tonsai, a super cool Bavarian girl, calls me `Der Beste Sicherer` -- I just means `The Best Belayer` in German.

There's a reason why I tell people that I'm the best at belaying. I don't believe that I am. I say it to bring attention to the least talked about aspect of climbing: good belaying. 

When someone hears me make that claim, it makes them stand on their toes. Consequently, this makes them more attentive to how they feed rope, what they do with their brake hand, how much attention they give to their climber, and all the nice little things that make climbing fun.

The purpose of these materials are to encourage discussion. These are not error-free references. I am bringing words and demonstrations into the table so that we can have something to take apart and make better.
