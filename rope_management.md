The goal of this video is to:

```
- Make sure that you feed the rope smoothly
- The rope stays in those quickdraws
- The rope stays in the that belay device
```

#### Knot check!

If there's no rope, there's nothing to manage. As a belayer, I make sure that I know the most commonly used tie-in knots:

```
- Eight knot
- Double bowline
- Double loop bowline
- Brotherhood knot
```

#### Flake the rope

This is how you flake the rope.

Also check for weak spots and cor shots.

#### Knot at the end

Even in single pitch climbing, there's a chance that you won't have a long enough rope. It is also a good practice in case you want to transition to multipitch climbing.

#### Pull the rope down mindfully

It's a rare as lightning striking the ground. But light does strike an odd tree. 

#### Where gate of the draws face

#### Gumbie tattoo 
Rope burn! 

#### Mind the cracks and tufas

#### Mind the big boulders

#### Heel hook 


#### Long draws!

There's a roof and an exit
The draws are off
The rope can potentially go around a tufa
