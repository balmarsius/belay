Before climbing with someone you've never climbed before, agree on a set of words and phrases to use to communicate. 

There are no right or wrong commands. Language is a social construct. Like with any construct, climbing commands can be discussed and agreed on. 

These are the commands I want to hear from my climber:

#### Climbing

- When they are about to hop on the rock
I want to be ready to spot you when you hop on the rock. I don't want to waste extra energy by holding my arms up one second longer when you are not climbing yet. Or not be ready to save your neck from getting broken 

- About to resume from hangdogging
This is important if your belayer is sitting on their harness to hold your weight. The moment you take your weight off of the rope, your belayer might drop their ass on the ground. 

Personally, when holding a hangdog, I keep my legs staggered with the front leg on a right angle -- like in a warrior one pose. In another video, I'll go into details about belaying someone who is projecting.

- If you are indirect on a bolt and about to climb

I want to sure that your not connected to that sling to avoid the chance of falling on it.

- Indirect

Let me know when you are clipped in to a bolt or the anchor so I can look at all the other climbers around and mind other people's business.
