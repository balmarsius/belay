When you watch the video of ## working `Perfecto Mundo`, you will hear him blame himself for being so weak.

This reveals an insight into the minds of the best climbers in the world: they do not complain that a hold is too slippery or the foothold is too high. They take responsibility for their performance; because they cannot change the features of the rock. However, they can change how they position their bodies or redesign their bodies in the training hall to come back stronger.

In the same vein, as a belayer, I take ownership of my belay.

If I short rope a climber, I own up to it and fix it by

- Observing my climber's clipping style 

If the rope is too sticky, I will maybe move a few centimeters back or pay extra attention to my climber's head movements; because most climbers look down around their tie-in point before clipping.
